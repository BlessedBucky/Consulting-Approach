# Consulting Approach - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the "Consulting Approach" course, where we perform a data analysis and provide business insights based on a dataset of car sales from Autoscout24 over the past decade. The project showcases the process of data wrangling, visual analysis, and presenting business recommendations in a consultancy format.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

1. **Data Analysis (R Code)**: 
   - The analysis is performed using R, and the code is designed to explore and visualize the data.
   - The code provides insights into car sales, such as the most popular brands, price distribution, car specifications (like horsepower), and more.

2. **Visualizations**: 
   - Various visualizations are generated from the dataset, including bar plots, box plots, and pie charts.
   - The charts illustrate key insights, such as the distribution of car brands, horsepower, price, and more.

3. **PPT Presentations**: 
   - The **car.ppt** presentation is created as part of the second-hand car dealer's business proposal.
   - The **answer.ppt** presentation is the final consultancy answer, providing insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

4. **Dataset**:
   - The dataset (`autoscout24-germany-dataset.csv`) contains car sales data from Autoscout24, including details like car brand, model, price, year, mileage, and more.
   
## Key Insights

- **Brand Popularity**: The analysis of car brands provides insights into the most popular brands based on sales volume.
- **Price Distribution**: The project includes an exploration of car prices, identifying outliers and comparing prices across brands.
- **Car Specifications**: Key specifications such as horsepower and fuel types are analyzed to understand their relationship with car prices and sales.
- **Mileage Analysis**: An in-depth look into the mileage of cars helps identify potential factors influencing the pricing and sales of used cars.

## How to Run the Code

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlessedBucky/Consulting-Approach.git
2. Set up your environment with the necessary packages. You can install the required R packages by running:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra"))
Open the Consulting_Approach.Rmd file in RStudio, and knit it to generate the visualizations and analysis.

3. The analysis and visualizations will be saved as outputs, which you can use to create your final report or presentation.
